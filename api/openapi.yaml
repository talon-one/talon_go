    Use the Talon.One API to integrate with your application and to
    manage applications and campaigns:

    - Use the operations in the [Integration API section](#integration-api)
    are used to integrate with our platform
    - Use the operation in the [Management API section](#management-api) to
    manage applications and campaigns.

    ## Determining the base URL of the endpoints

    The API is available at the same hostname as your Campaign Manager deployment.
    For example, if you access the Campaign Manager at `https://yourbaseurl.talon.one/`,
    the URL for the [updateCustomerSessionV2](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/updateCustomerSessionV2) endpoint
    is `https://yourbaseurl.talon.one/v2/customer_sessions/{Id}`

        Upload a CSV file containing the coupons that should be created. The file should be sent as multipart data.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:

        - `value` (required): The coupon code.
        - `expirydate`: The end date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `startdate`: The start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `recipientintegrationid`: The integration ID of the recipient of the coupon.
          Only the customer with this integration ID can redeem this code. Available only for personal codes.
        - `limitval`: The maximum number of redemptions of this code. For unlimited redemptions, use `0`. Defaults to `1` when not provided.
        - `discountlimit`: The total discount value that the code can give. This is typically used to represent a gift card value.
        - `attributes`: A JSON object describing _custom_ coupon attribute names and their values, enclosed with double quotation marks.

          For example, if you created a [custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)
          called `category` associated with the coupon entity, the object in the CSV file, when opened in a text editor, must be: `"{"category": "10_off"}"`.

        You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

        **Example:**

        ```text
        "value","expirydate","startdate","recipientintegrationid","limitval","attributes","discountlimit"
        COUP1,2018-07-01T04:00:00Z,2018-05-01T04:00:00Z,cust123,1,"{""Category"": ""10_off""}",2.4
        ```

        Once imported, you can find the `batchId` in the Campaign Manager or by
        using [List coupons](#tag/Coupons/operation/getCouponsWithoutTotalCount).

        Upload a CSV file containing the referrals that should be created.
        The file should be sent as multipart data.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:

        - `code` (required): The referral code.
        - `advocateprofileintegrationid` (required): The profile ID of the advocate.
        - `startdate`: The start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `expirydate`: The end date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `limitval`: The maximum number of redemptions of this code. Defaults to `1` when left blank.
        - `attributes`: A JSON object describing _custom_ referral attribute names and their values, enclosed with double quotation marks.

          For example, if you created a [custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)
          called `category` associated with the referral entity, the object in the CSV file, when opened in a text editor, must be: `"{"category": "10_off"}"`.

        You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Important:** When you import a CSV file with referrals, a [customer profile](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-profiles)
        is **not** automatically created for each `advocateprofileintegrationid` column value. Use the [Update customer profile](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Customer-profiles/operation/updateCustomerProfileV2)
        endpoint or the [Update multiple customer profiles](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Customer-profiles/operation/updateCustomerProfilesV2)
        endpoint to create the customer profiles.

        **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

        These attributes can then be given values when creating/updating these entities, and these values can be
        used in your campaign rules.

        For example, you could define a `zipCode` field for customer sessions,
        and add a rule to your campaign that only allows certain ZIP codes.

        These attributes are shared across all Applications in your account and are never required.

        Upload a CSV file containing a list of [picklist values](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-attributes#picklist-values) for the specified attribute.

        The file should be sent as multipart data.

        The import **replaces** the previous list of allowed values for this attribute, if any.

        The CSV file **must** only contain the following column:
        - `item` (required): the values in your allowed list, for example a list of SKU's.

        An allowed list is limited to 500,000 items.

        Example:

        ```text
        item
        CS-VG-04032021-UP-50D-10
        CS-DV-04042021-UP-49D-12

        - Update the attributes of an item in the catalog.
        - Update the attributes of multiple items in the catalog.
        - Remove an item from the catalog.
        - Remove multiple items from the catalog.

        You can either add, update, or delete up to 1000 cart items in a single request. Each item synced to a catalog must have a unique `SKU`.

        **Important**: You can perform only one type of action in a single sync request. Syncing items with duplicate `SKU` values in a single request returns an error message with a `400` status code.

        For more information, read [managing cart item catalogs](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-cart-item-catalogs).

        ### Filtering cart items

        Use [cart item attributes](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-attributes)
        to filter items and select the ones you want to edit or delete when editing or deleting more than one item
        at a time.

        The `filters` array contains an object with the following properties:

        - `attr`: A [cart item attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-attributes)
          connected to the catalog. It is applied to all items in the catalog.
        - `op`: The filtering operator indicating the relationship between the value of each
          cart item in the catalog and the value of the `value` property for the attribute selected
          in `attr`.

          The value of `op` can be one of the following:

          - `EQ`: Equal to `value`
          - `LT`: Less than `value`
          - `LE`: Less than or equal to `value`
          - `GT`: Greater than `value`
          - `GE`: Greater than or equal to `value`
          - `IN`: One of the comma-separated values that `value` is set to.

          **Note:** `GE`, `LE`, `GT`, `LT` are for numeric values only.

        - `value`: The value of the attribute selected in `attr`.

        The CSV file **must** only contain the following column:

        - `item`: the values in your collection.

        A collection is limited to 500,000 items.

        Example:

        ```
        item

        Nike
        Asics
        ```

        **Note:** Before sending a request to this endpoint, ensure the data in the CSV to import is different from the data currently stored in the collection.

        Create a coupon reservation for the specified customer profiles on the specified coupon.
        You can also create a reservation via the Campaign Manager using the
        [Create coupon code reservation effect](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/using-effects#reserving-a-coupon-code).

        - If the **Reservation mandatory** option was selected when creating the specified coupon,
        the endpoint creates a **hard** reservation, meaning only users who have this coupon code reserved can redeem it.
        Otherwise, the endpoint creates a **soft** reservation, meaning the coupon will be associated with the specified customer profiles (they show up when using the [List customer data](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/getCustomerInventory) endpoint), but any user can redeem it.
        This can be useful, for example, to display a _coupon wallet_ for customers when they visit your store.
         - If the **Coupon visibility** option was selected when creating the specified coupon,
        the coupon code is implicitly soft-reserved for all customers, and the code will be returned for all customer profiles in the [List customer data](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/getCustomerInventory) endpoint.

        To delete a reservation, use the [Delete reservation](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Coupons/operation/deleteCouponReservation) endpoint.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:

        - `id`: The internal ID of the giveaway.
        - `poolid`: The internal ID of the giveaway pool.
        - `code`: The giveaway code.
        - `startdate`: The validity start date in RFC3339 of the giveaway (can be empty).

        - `attributes`: Any custom attributes associated with the giveaway code (can be empty).
        - `used`: An indication of whether the giveaway is already awarded.
        - `importid`: The ID of the import which created the giveaway.
        - `created`: The creation time of the giveaway code.
        - `profileintegrationid`: The third-party integration ID of the customer profile that was awarded the giveaway. Can be empty if the giveaway was not awarded.
        - `profileid`: The internal ID of the customer profile that was awarded the giveaway. Can be empty if the giveaway was not awarded or an internal ID does not exist.

        Upload a CSV file containing the giveaway codes that should be created. Send the file as multipart data.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:
        - `code` (required): The code of your giveaway, for instance, a gift card redemption code.
        - `startdate`:  The start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `enddate`: The last date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `attributes`: A JSON object describing _custom_ giveaway attribute names and their values, enclosed with double quotation marks.

          For example, if you created a [custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)
          called `provider` associated with the giveaway entity, the object in the CSV file, when opened in a text editor, must be: `"{"provider": "myPartnerCompany"}"`.

        The `startdate` and `enddate` have nothing to do with the _validity_ of the codes. They are only used by the Rule Engine to award the codes or not.
        You can use the time zone setting of your choice. The values are converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Note:**

        - We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.
        - You can import the same code multiple times. Duplicate codes are treated and distributed to customers as unique codes.

        **Example:**

        ```text
        code,startdate,enddate,attributes
        GIVEAWAY1,2020-11-10T23:00:00Z,2022-11-11T23:00:00Z,"{""provider"": ""Amazon""}"

    post:
      description: |
        Upload a CSV file containing existing customers to be assigned to existing tiers.
        Send the file as multipart data.

        **Important:** This endpoint only works with loyalty programs with advanced tiers (with expiration and downgrade policy) feature enabled.

        The CSV file should contain the following columns:
        - `subledgerid` (optional): The ID of the subledger. If this field is empty, the main ledger will be used.
        - `customerprofileid`: The integration ID of the customer profile to whom the tier should be assigned.
        - `tiername`: The name of an existing tier to assign to the customer.
        - `expirydate`: The expiration date of the tier. It should be a future date.

        About customer assignment to a tier:
        - If the customer isn't already in a tier, the customer is assigned to the specified tier during the tier import.
        - If the customer is already in the tier that's specified in the CSV file, only the expiration date is updated.

        **Note:** We recommend not using this endpoint to update the tier of a customer.
        To update a customer's tier, you can [add](/management-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/addLoyaltyPoints) or [deduct](/management-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/removeLoyaltyPoints) their loyalty points.

        You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

    post:
      description: |
        Upload a CSV file containing the loyalty points you want to import into a given loyalty program.
        Send the file as multipart data.

        Depending on the type of loyalty program, you can import points into a given customer profile or loyalty card.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:

        - `customerprofileid` (optional): For profile-based loyalty programs, the integration ID of the customer profile where the loyalty points are imported.
        - `identifier` (optional): For card-based loyalty programs, the identifier of the loyalty card where the loyalty points are imported.
        - `amount`: The amount of points to award to the customer profile.
        - `startdate` (optional): The earliest date when the points can be redeemed. The points are `active` from this date until the expiration date.

          **Note**: It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string or string `immediate`. Empty or missing values are considered `immediate`.
        - `expirydate` (optional): The latest date when the points can be redeemed. The points are `expired` after this date.

          **Note**: It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string or string `unlimited`. Empty or missing values are considered `unlimited`.
        - `subledgerid` (optional): The ID of the subledger that should received the points.
        - `reason` (optional): The reason why these points are awarded.

        You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Note:** For existing customer profiles and loyalty cards, the imported points are added to any previous active or pending points, depending on the
        value provided for `startdate`. If `startdate` matches the current date, the imported points are _active_. If it is later, the points are _pending_ until
        the date provided for `startdate` is reached.

        **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

        **Example for profile-based programs:**

        ```text
        customerprofileid,amount,startdate,expirydate,subledgerid,reason

        ```

        **Example for card-based programs:**

        ```text
        identifier,amount,startdate,expirydate,subledgerid,reason

        Create an audience. The audience can be created directly from scratch or can come from third party platforms.

        **Note:** Audiences can also be created from scratch via the Campaign Manager. See the [docs](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/audiences/creating-audiences).

        To create an audience from an existing audience from a [technology partner](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/technology-partners/overview):
        1. Set the `integration` property to `mparticle`, `segment` etc., depending on a third-party platform.
        1. Set `integrationId` to the ID of this audience in a third-party platform.

        To create an audience from an existing audience in another platform:
        1. Do not use the `integration` property.
        1. Set `integrationId` to the ID of this audience in the 3rd-party platform.

        To create an audience from scratch:
        1. Only set the `name` property.

        Once you create your first audience, audience-specific rule conditions are enabled in the Rule Builder.

        Update or create a [Customer Profile](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-profiles). This endpoint triggers the Rule Builder.

        You can use this endpoint to:
        - Set attributes on the given customer profile. Ensure you create the attributes in the Campaign Manager, first.
        - Modify the audience the customer profile is a member of.

        Update or create a [customer session](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-sessions).
        The endpoint responds with the potential promotion rule [effects](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/integration-api/api-effects) that match the current cart.
        For example, use this endpoint to share the contents of a customer's cart with Talon.One.

        **Note:** The currency for the session and the cart items in the session is the currency set for the
        Application that owns this session.

        ### Session management

        To use this endpoint, start by learning about [customer sessions](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-sessions)
        and their states and refer to the `state` parameter documentation the request body schema docs below.

        ### Sessions and customer profiles

        - To link a session to a customer profile, set the `profileId` parameter in the request body to a customer profile's `integrationId`.
        - While you can create an anonymous session with `profileId=""`, we recommend you use a guest ID instead.
        - A profile can be linked to simultaneous sessions in different Applications. Either:
          - Use unique session integration IDs or,
          - Use the same session integration ID across all of the Applications.

        **Note:** If the specified profile does not exist, an empty profile is **created automatically**.
          You can update it with [Update customer profile](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Customer-profiles/operation/updateCustomerProfileV2).

        <div class="redoc-section">
          <p class="title">Performance tips</p>

          - Updating a customer session returns a response with the new integration state. Use the `responseContent` property to save yourself extra API calls.
            For example, you can get the customer profile details directly without extra requests.
          - We recommend sending requests sequentially. See [Managing parallel requests](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/getting-started/integration-tutorial#managing-parallel-requests).

            When you do not use the `dry` parameter, the endpoint behaves as a typical PUT endpoint. Each update builds upon the previous ones.
          - You can use the `evaluableCampaignIds` body property to select specific campaigns to run.

        For example, if a session has been completed but still needs to be edited, you can reopen it with this endpoint.
        A reopen session is treated like a standard open session.

        When reopening a session:
        - The `talon_session_reopened` event is triggered. You can see it in the **Events** view in the Campaign Manager.
        - The session state is updated to `open`.
        - Modified budgets and triggered effects when the session was closed are rolled back except for the list below.

        Triggers a custom event.

        To use this endpoint:
        1. Define a [custom event](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/events#creating-a-custom-event) in the Campaign Manager.
        1. Update or create a rule to check for this event.
        1. Trigger the event with this endpoint. After you have successfully sent an event to Talon.One, you can list the received events in the **Events** view in the Campaign Manager.

        Talon.One also offers a set of [built-in events](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/events). Ensure you do not create
        a custom event when you can use a built-in event.

        For example, use this endpoint to trigger an event when a customer shares a link to a product.
        See the [tutorial](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/tutorials/referrals/incentivizing-product-link-sharing).

        <div class="redoc-section">

          <p class="title">Important</p>

          1. `profileId` is required even though the schema does not say it.
          1. If the customer profile ID is new, a new profile is automatically created but the `customer_profile_created` [built-in event ](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/events) is **not** triggered.
          1. We recommend sending requests sequentially. See [Managing parallel requests](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/getting-started/integration-tutorial#managing-parallel-requests).

        [Loyalty cards](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/card-based/card-based-overview) allow customers to collect
        and spend loyalty points within a [card-based loyalty program](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/overview#loyalty-program-types).
        They are useful to gamify loyalty programs and can be used with or without customer profiles linked to them.

        Link a customer profile to a given loyalty card for the card to be set as **Registered**.
        This affects how it can be used. See the [docs](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/card-based/managing-loyalty-cards#linking-customer-profiles-to-a-loyalty-card).

        **Note:** You can link as many customer profiles to a given loyalty card as the [**card user limit**](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/card-based/creating-cb-programs) allows.

        To authenticate to use the Integration API, generate an API key in the Campaign Manager
        then prefix it with `ApiKey-v1`.

        To generate an API key:

        1. Log into the Campaign Manager and open the Application of your choice, or create one.
        1. Click **Settings** > **Developer settings**.
        1. Click **Create API Key** and give it a name and an expiration date, then click **Create API Key**.

        You can now use the API key in the HTTP header, prefixing it with `ApiKey-v1`:

        ```
        Authorization: ApiKey-v1 dbc644d33aa74d582bd9479c59e16f970fe13bf3
        ```

        Or use it inside [an SDK](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/sdks/overview), for example, with the JAVA SDK:

        ```
        iApi.getApiClient().setApiKeyPrefix("ApiKey-v1");
        iApi.getApiClient().setApiKey("dbc644d33aa74d582bd9479c59e16f970fe13bf3");
        ```

        The API key authentication gives you access to the endpoints selected by the admin who created the key.
        Using an API key is the recommended authentication method.

        The key must be generated by an admin and given to the developer that requires it:

        1. Log into the Campaign Manager and click **Account** > **Management API keys**.
        1. Click **Create Key** and give it a name.
        1. Set an expiration date.
        1. Choose the endpoints the key should give access to.
        1. Click **Create Key**.
        1. Share it with your developer.

        The developer can now use the API key in the HTTP header, prefixing it with `ManagementKey-v1`:

        ```
        Authorization: ManagementKey-v1 bd9479c59e16f9dbc644d33aa74d58270fe13bf3
        ```
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      type: apiKey
    manager_auth:
      description: |
        This authentication scheme relies on a bearer token that you can use to access all the endpoints of the Management API.

        To create the token:

        1. Get a bearer token by calling the [createSession](#operation/createSession) endpoint.
        1. Use the `token` property of the response in the HTTP header of your next queries:
           `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN`.

        A token is valid for 3 months. In accordance with best pratices, use your generated token
        for all your API requests. Do **not** regenerate a token for each request.

        **Note:** We recommend that you use a [Management API key](https://docs.talon.one/management-api#section/Authentication/management_key)
        instead of a bearer token.

    Use the Talon.One API to integrate with your application and to
    manage applications and campaigns:

    - Use the operations in the [Integration API section](#integration-api)
    are used to integrate with our platform
    - Use the operation in the [Management API section](#management-api) to
    manage applications and campaigns.

    ## Determining the base URL of the endpoints

    The API is available at the same hostname as your Campaign Manager deployment.
    For example, if you access the Campaign Manager at `https://yourbaseurl.talon.one/`,
    the URL for the [updateCustomerSessionV2](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/updateCustomerSessionV2) endpoint
    is `https://yourbaseurl.talon.one/v2/customer_sessions/{Id}`

        The endpoint responds with the potential promotion rule [effects](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/integration-api/api-effects) that match the current cart.
        For example, use this endpoint to share the contents of a customer's cart with Talon.One.

        **Note:** The currency for the session and the cart items in the session is the currency set for the
        Application that owns this session.

        ### Session management

        To use this endpoint, start by learning about [customer sessions](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities#customer-session)
        and their states and refer to the `state` parameter documentation the request body schema docs below.

        ### Sessions and customer profiles

        - To link a session to a customer profile, set the `profileId` parameter in the request body to a customer profile's `integrationId`.
        - While you can create an anonymous session with `profileId=""`, we recommend you use a guest ID instead.
        - A profile can be linked to simultaneous sessions in different Applications. Either:
          - Use unique session integration IDs or,
          - Use the same session integration ID across all of the Applications.

        **Note:** If the specified profile does not exist, an empty profile is **created automatically**.
        You can update it with [Update customer profile](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Customer-profiles/operation/updateCustomerProfileV2).

        <div class="redoc-section">
          <p class="title">Performance tips</p>

          Updating a customer session returns a response with the new integration state. Use the `responseContent` property to save yourself extra API calls.
          For example, you can get the customer profile details directly without extra requests.

        **Note:** Audiences can also be created from scratch via the Campaign Manager. See the [docs](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/audiences/creating-audiences).

        To create an audience from an existing audience from a [technology partner](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/technology-partners/overview):
        1. Set the `integration` property to `mparticle`, `segment` etc., depending on a third-party platform.
        1. Set `integrationId` to the ID of this audience in a third-party platform.

        To create an audience from an existing audience in another platform:
        1. Do not use the `integration` property.
        1. Set `integrationId` to the ID of this audience in the 3rd-party platform.

        To create an audience from scratch:
        1. Only set the `name` property.

        Once you create your first audience, audience-specific rule conditions are enabled in the Rule Builder.

        Triggers a custom event. You can build a condition around this event in your rules.

        Talon.One offers a set of [built-in events](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/events). Ensure you do not create
        a custom event when you can use a built-in event.

        For example, use this endpoint to trigger an event when a customer shares a link to a product.
        See the [tutorial](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/tutorials/referrals/incentivizing-product-link-sharing).

        **Important:**
        - `profileId` is required. An event V2 is associated with a customer profile.
        - Before using this endpoint, create your event as a custom attribute of type `event`.
        See the [Developer docs](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/events#creating-a-custom-event).

        When you successfully sent an event to Talon.One, you can list received events in the
        **Events** view in the Campaign Manager.

        Create a coupon reservation for specified customer profiles on the specified coupon.
        You can also create a reservation via the Campaign Manager using the
        [Create coupon code reservation effect](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/using-effects#reserving-a-coupon-code).

        Reserving a coupon allows you to associate a coupon code to a given customer(s).
        You can then list the reserved coupons of a given customer
        with the [List customer data](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/getCustomerInventory) endpoint.

        If a coupon gets created for a specific user, it will automatically appear in their coupons.

        When a user redeems a coupon, a reservation is automatically created after the redemption and
        the used coupon will be returned in the [List customer data](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/getCustomerInventory) endpoint.

        For example, you can use this endpoint and `List customer data` to create a _coupon wallet_ by
        reserving coupon codes for a customer, and then displaying their coupon wallet
        when they visit your store.

        <div class="redoc-section">
          <p class="title">Important</p>

          This endpoint creates a **soft** reservation. _Any_ customer
          can use a reserved coupon code and proceed to checkout.

          To create a hard reservation, you can:
          - use the [Create coupons](https://docs.talon.one/management-api#operation/createCoupons) endpoint or,
          - use the [Create coupons for multiple recipients](https://docs.talon.one/management-api#operation/createCouponsForMultipleRecipients)
            endpoint setting the `recipientsIntegrationId` property or,
          - create a coupon code with the **Reservation mandatory** option then use the [Create coupon code reservation effect](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/using-effects#reserving-a-coupon-code).
        </div>

        To delete a reservation, use the [Delete reservation](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Coupons/operation/deleteCouponReservation) endpoint.

        Loyalty balances are calculated when Talon.One receives your request using the points stored in our database, so retrieving a large number of balances at once can impact performance.

        Create a

        A notification about campaign-related changes is different from regular webhooks
        in that it is Application-scoped and has a predefined payload.
        [Regular webhooks](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/getting-started/webhooks) have user-definable payloads.

        **Tip:**

        - You can create these notifications using the Campaign Manager.
        See [Managing notifications](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/applications/outbound-notifications).
        - You can review the payload you will receive in the [specs](https://docs.talon.one/outbound-notifications#/paths/campaign_created/post).

  /v1/loyalty_programs/{loyaltyProgramId}/import_points:
    post:
      description: |
        Upload a CSV file containing the loyalty points you want to import into a given loyalty program.
        Send the file as multipart data.

        Depending on the loyalty program type, you can import the points into a given customer profile or into a given _active_ loyalty card.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:

        - `customerprofileid` (optional): For profile-based loyalty programs, the integration ID of the customer profile where the loyalty points are imported.
        - `identifier` (optional): For card-based loyalty programs, the identifier of the loyalty card where the loyalty points are imported.
        - `amount`: The amount of points to award to the customer profile.
        - `startdate`: The earliest date when the points can be redeemed. On this date and until the expiration date, the points are `active`.
        - `expirydate`: The latest date when the points can be redeemed. After this date, the points are `expired`.
        - `subledgerid` (optional): The ID of the subledger that should received the points.
        - `reason` (optional): The reason why these points are awarded.

        You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Note:** For existing customer profiles and loyalty cards, the imported points are added to any previous active or pending points, depending on the
        value provided for `startdate`. If `startdate` matches the current date, the imported points are _active_. If it is later, the points are _pending_ until
        the date provided for `startdate` is reached.

        **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

        **Example for profile-based programs:**

        ```text
        customerprofileid,amount,startdate,expirydate,subledgerid,reason
        URNGV8294NV,100,2009-11-10T23:00:00Z,2009-11-11T23:00:00Z,subledger1,appeasement
        ```

        **Example for card-based programs:**

        ```text
        identifier,amount,startdate,expirydate,subledgerid,reason
        summer-loyalty-card-0543,100,2009-11-10T23:00:00Z,2009-11-11T23:00:00Z,subledger1,appeasement

        Upload a CSV file containing the giveaway codes that should be created. Send the file as multipart data.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:
        - `code` (required): the code of your giveaway, for instance, a gift card redemption code.
        - `startdate`:  the start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `enddate`: the last date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `attributes`: A json object describing _custom_ giveaway attribute names and their values. Double the double-quotes in the object.
          For example, if you [created a custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)
          called `provider` associated to the giveaway entity, set it with `"{""provider"": ""myPartnerCompany""}"`.

        The `startdate` and `enddate` have nothing to do with the _validity_ of the codes. They are only used by the Rule Engine to award the codes or not.
        You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

        **Example:**

        ```text
        code,startdate,enddate,attributes

        Create a _custom attribute_ in this account.
        [Custom attributes](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes) allow you
        to add data to Talon.One domain entities like campaigns, coupons,
        customers and so on.

        These attributes can then be given values when creating/updating these entities, and these values can be
        used in your campaign rules.

        For example, you could define a `zipCode` field for customer sessions,
        and add a rule to your campaign that only allows certain ZIP codes.

        These attributes are shared across all Applications in your account and are never required.

        Perform one or more of the following sync actions on this cart item catalog, up to 1000 actions:

        - Add an item to the catalog.
        - Edit the attributes of an item in the catalog.
        - Edit the attributes of more than one item in the catalog.
        - Remove an item from the catalog.
        - Remove more than one item from the catalog.

        **Note:** For more information, see [our documentation on managing cart item catalogs](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-cart-item-catalogs).

        ### Filtering cart items

        Use [cart item attributes](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-cart-item-catalogs#displaying-the-details-and-content-of-a-catalog)
        to filter items and select the ones you want to edit or delete when editing or deleting more than one item
        at a time.

        The `filters` array contains an object with the following properties:

        - `attr`: A [cart item attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-attributes)
          connected to the catalog. It is applied to all items in the catalog.
        - `op`: The filtering operator indicating the relationship between the value of each
          cart item in the catalog and the value of the `value` property for the attribute selected
          in `attr`.

          The value of `op` can be one of the following:

          - `EQ`: Equal to `value`
          - `LT`: Less than `value`
          - `LE`: Less than or equal to `value`
          - `GT`: Greater than `value`
          - `GE`: Greater than or equal to `value`
          - `IN`: One of the comma-separated values that `value` is set to.

          **Note:** `GE`, `LE`, `GT`, `LT` are for numeric values only.

        - `value`: The value of the attribute selected in `attr`.

        ### Payload examples

        Synchronization actions are sent as `PUT` requests. See the structure for each action:

    post:
      description: |
        Upload a CSV file containing the coupons that should be created. The file should be sent as multipart data.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:

        - `value` (required): The coupon code.
        - `expirydate`: The end date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `startdate`: The start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `recipientintegrationid`: The integration ID of the customer who receives the coupon.
          Only the customer with this integration ID can redeem the corresponding coupon code.
          Learn about [coupon reservation](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/using-effects#reserving-a-coupon-code).
        - `limitval`: The maximum number of redemptions of this code. For unlimited redemptions, use `0`. Defaults to `1` when not provided.
        - `discountlimit`: The total discount value that the code can give. This is typically used to represent a gift card value.
        - `attributes`: A json object describing _custom_ referral attribute names and their values. Double the double-quotes in the object.
          For example, if you created a [custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)
          called `category` associated to the coupon entity, set it with `"{""category"": ""10_off""}"`.

        You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

        **Example:**

        ```text
        "value","expirydate","startdate","recipientintegrationid","limitval","attributes","discountlimit"
        COUP1,2018-07-01T04:00:00Z,2018-05-01T04:00:00Z,cust123,1,"{""Category"": ""10_off""}",2.4
        ```

        Once imported, you can find the `batchId` in the Campaign Manager or by
        using [List coupons](#tag/Coupons/operation/getCouponsWithoutTotalCount).

        Upload a CSV file containing the referrals that should be created.
        The file should be sent as multipart data.

        The CSV file contains the following columns:

        - `code` (required): The referral code.
        - `advocateprofileintegrationid` (required): The profile ID of the advocate.
        - `startdate`: The start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `expirydate`: The end date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `limitval`: The maximum number of redemptions of this code. Defaults to `1` when left blank.
        - `attributes`: A json object describing _custom_ referral attribute names and their values. Double the double-quotes in the object.

          For example, if you [created a custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)
          called `category` associated to the referral entity, set it with `"{""category"": ""10_off""}"`.

        You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

        To authenticate to use the Integration API, generate an API key in the Campaign Manager
        then prefix it with `ApiKey-v1`.

        To generate an API key:

        1. Log into the Campaign Manager and open the Application of your choice, or create one.
        1. Click **Settings** > **Developer settings**.
        1. Click **Create API Key** and give it a name and an expiration date, then click **Create API Key**.

        You can now use the API key in the HTTP header, prefixing it with `ApiKey-v1`:

        ```
        Authorization: ApiKey-v1 dbc644d33aa74d582bd9479c59e16f970fe13bf3
        ```

        Or use it inside [an SDK](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/sdks/overview), for example, with the JAVA SDK:

        ```
        iApi.getApiClient().setApiKeyPrefix("ApiKey-v1");
        iApi.getApiClient().setApiKey("dbc644d33aa74d582bd9479c59e16f970fe13bf3");
        ```
      in: header

      type: apiKey
    manager_auth:
      description: |
        This authentication scheme relies on a bearer token that you can use to access all the endpoints of the Management API.

        To create the token:

        1. Get a bearer token by calling the [createSession](#operation/createSession) endpoint.
        1. Use the `token` property of the response in the HTTP header of your next queries:
           `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN`.

        A token is valid for 3 months. In accordance with best pratices, use your generated token
        for all your API requests. Do **not** regenerate a token for each request.

        **Note:** We recommend that you use a [Management API key](https://docs.talon.one/management-api#section/Authentication/management_key)
        instead of a bearer token.

    management_key:
      description: |
        The API key authentication gives you access to the endpoints selected by the admin who created the key.
        Using an API key is the recommended authentication method.

        The key must be generated by an admin and given to the developer that requires it:

        1. Log into the Campaign Manager and click **Account** > **Management API keys**.
        1. Click **Create Key** and give it a name.
        1. Set an expiration date.
        1. Choose the endpoints the key should give access to.
        1. Click **Create Key**.
        1. Share it with your developer.

        The developer can now use the API key in the HTTP header, prefixing it with `ManagementKey-v1`:

        ```
        Authorization: ManagementKey-v1 bd9479c59e16f9dbc644d33aa74d58270fe13bf3
        ```
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      type: apiKey

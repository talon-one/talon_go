    The Talon.One API is used to manage applications and campaigns, as well as to
    integrate with your application. The operations in the _Integration API_ section
    are used to integrate with our platform, while the other operations are
    used to manage applications and campaigns.

    ### Where is the API?

    The API is available at the same hostname as these docs. For example, if you are reading this page at `https://mycompany.talon.one/docs/api/`, the URL for the [updateCustomerProfile][] operation is `https://mycompany.talon.one/v1/customer_profiles/id`

    [updateCustomerProfile]: #operation--v1-customer_profiles--integrationId--put

    Use the Integration API to push data into the Talon.One platform.

    For example, use it to create customer profiles and sessions to follow and process their activity.
    You can also create custom events to track specific actions that do not fit into the session data model.

    Ensure you [authenticate](https://developers.talon.one/Integration-API/Authentication) to make requests to the API.

    Every request to the Integration API comes from an application. An application is typically an e-commerce site, a mobile app, or some other source of customer actions.
    An application is the owner of the API key used to send integration data.
    You may have multiple applications within one account, for example staging and production, or different international markets.

    A referral is a code shared between a customer and a prospect.
    A referral is defined by an advocate, a friend and a referral code. The advocate is the person who
    invited their friend via referral program. The friend is the person who receives the invite from an advocate.
    The referral code is a code which is generated similar to a coupon code the code can be redeemed by
    either one or multiple advocates.

        Update (or create) a [Customer Session](https://developers.talon.one/Getting-Started/entities#/customer-session).
        For example, use this endpoint to represent which items are in the customer's cart.

        The Talon.One platform supports multiple simultaneous sessions for the same profile. If you have multiple ways of accessing the same application you can either:

        - Track multiple independent sessions or,
        - Use the same session across all of them.

        You should share sessions when application access points share other state, such as the user's cart.
        If two points of access to the application have independent states, for example a user can have different
        items in their cart across the two) they should use independent customer session ID's.

        To link a session to a customer profile, set the `profileId` parameter in the request body to a customer profile's `integrationId`.
        To track an anonymous session use the empty string (`""`) as the `profileId`.
        **Note:** You do **not** have to create a customer profile first. If the specified profile does not exist, an empty profile is created automatically.

        Updating a customer session returns a response with the requested integration state. If `runRuleEngine` is set to `true`, the response includes:

        - The effects generated by the triggered campaigns.
        - The created coupons and referral objects.
        - Any entity that was requested in the `responseContent` request parameter.

        The currency for the session and the cart items in the session is the same as that of the application with which the session is associated.

        Update (or create) a [Customer Profile](https://developers.talon.one/Getting-Started/entities#/customer-profile). This profile information can then be matched and/or updated by campaign [Rules][].

        The `integrationId` may be any identifier that will remain stable for the customer. For example, you might use a database ID, an email, or a phone number as the `integrationId`. It is vital that this ID **not** change over time, so **don't** use any identifier that the customer can update themselves. E.g. if your application allows a customer to update their e-mail address, you should instead use a database ID.

        Updating a customer profile will return a response with the full integration state. This includes the current state of the customer profile, the customer session, the event that was recorded, and an array of effects that took place.

        Upload a CSV file containing the giveaways codes that should be created. Send the file as multipart data.

        The CSV file can contain the following columns:
        - `code` (required): the code of your giveaway, for instance, a gift card redemption code.
        - `startdate`:  the start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `enddate`: the last date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `attributes`: A json object describing _custom_ giveaways attribute names and their values. Double the double-quotes in the object.
          For example, if you created a custom attribute called `provider`, set it with `"{""provider"": ""myPartnerCompany""}"`.

        The `startdate` and `enddate` have nothing to do with the _validity_ of the codes. They are only used by the Rule Engine to award the codes or not.
        You can use the timezone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        Defines a new _custom attribute_ in this account. Custom attributes allow you to attach new fields to Talon.One domain objects like campaigns, coupons, customers and so on. These attributes can then be given values when creating / updating these objects, and these values can be used in your campaign rules. For example, you could define a `zipCode` field for customer sessions, and add a rule to your campaign that only allows certain ZIP codes.

        These attributes are shared across all applications in your account, and are never required.

        Updates an existing custom attribute. Once created, the only property of a custom attribute that can be changed is the title (human readable description). This restriction is in place to prevent accidentally breaking live integrations. E.g. if you have a customer profile attribute with the name `region`, and your integration is sending `attributes.region` with customer profile updates, changing the name to `locale` would cause the integration requests to begin failing.

        If you **really** need to change the `type` or `name` property of a custom attribute, create a new attribute and update any relevant integrations and rules to use the new attribute. Then delete the old attribute when you are confident you have migrated any needed data from the old attribute to the new one.

        The CSV file can contain the following colums:

        - `code` (required): the referral code.
        - `advocateprofileintegrationid` (required): The profile ID of the advocate.
        - `startdate`: the start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `expirydate`: the end date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.
        - `limitval`: The maximum amount of redemptions of this code. Unlimited (0) when blank.
        - `attributes`: A json object describing _custom_ referral attribute names and their values. Double the double-quotes in the object.
          For example, if you created a custom attribute called `category`, set it with `"{""category"": ""10_off""}"`.

        You can use the timezone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.

        The Integration API authentication scheme. To use it, generate an API key in the Campaign Manager
        then prefix it with `ApiKey-v1`.

        For example, using the JAVA SDK:

        ```
        iApi.getApiClient().setApiKeyPrefix("ApiKey-v1");
        iApi.getApiClient().setApiKey("dbc644d33aa74d582bd9479c59e16f970fe13bf3");
        ```

        Or using the HTTP header:

        ```
        Authorization: ApiKey-v1 dbc644d33aa74d582bd9479c59e16f970fe13bf3
